# see The See Drone - crowd counting

## Overview
This project is an implementation of advanced image analysis using deep learning, specifically focusing on crowd counting and density estimation in images. It leverages the methodologies proposed in the Shanghai datasets research, particularly the use of multi-column convolutional neural networks for single-image crowd counting.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pash10/see-the-see`
2. Ensure you are using Python 3.6.10 and TensorFlow 2.2.0, as they are mandatory for this project. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy scipy opencv-python pillow matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
### Preprocessing
Run `Preprocess.py` to prepare your image data, applying Gaussian filtering for density map generation.
```bash
python Preprocess.py [arguments or options]
```

### Model
`Model.py` defines the neural network architecture for image analysis, inspired by the Shanghai dataset's methodologies.
```bash
python Model.py [arguments or options]
```

### Inference
Use `Inference.py` to load the model and perform inference on new image data.
```bash
python Inference.py [arguments or options]
```

## Examples
Here are some example commands to get you started:
```bash
# Preprocessing example
python Preprocess.py --input [input_path] --output [output_path]

# Model setup example
python Model.py --train [train_data_path]

# Inference example
python Inference.py --model [model_path] --image [image_path]
```
