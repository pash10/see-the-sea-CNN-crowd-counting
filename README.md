See The Sea Drone - Advanced Crowd Counting
Overview

See The Sea Drone - Advanced Crowd Counting is a cutting-edge project focused on the application of deep learning techniques for the quantification and analysis of crowds in images. Leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies from renowned academic research, specifically the Shanghai datasets, this project employs sophisticated multi-column convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tailored for accurate single-image crowd counting. This solution is ideal for applications ranging from public safety monitoring to event management.
