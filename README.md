## Overview
This project implements advanced image analysis using deep learning, focusing on crowd counting and density estimation in images. It incorporates the methodologies from the Shanghai datasets research, especially the multi-column convolutional neural networks for single-image crowd counting.
working on the code 

## Installation
**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.6.10
- TensorFlow 2.2.0

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pash10/see-the-see
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy scipy opencv-python pillow matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
### Preprocessing
The `Preprocess.py` script applies Gaussian filtering to generate density maps from image data.
```bash
python Preprocess.py [arguments or options]
```

### Model
The `Model.py` script defines the neural network architecture for image analysis.
```bash
python Model.py [arguments or options]
```

### Inference
The `Inference.py` script loads the model and performs inference on new images.
```bash
python Inference.py [arguments or options]
```

## Examples
To get started, use these example commands:
```bash
# Preprocessing
python Preprocess.py 

# Model setup
python Model.py 

# Inference
python Inference.py 
```

### Based on CSRNet-keras Project
This project is an adaptation and enhancement of the CSRNet-keras project, initially developed by contributors at Neerajj9's GitHub. My contributions focus on optimizing and streamlining the original code to improve its efficiency and usability, including a significant format change from Jupyter Notebook to standard Python scripts.

#### Original Project Details
- **Title**: CSRNet-keras
- **Author(s)**: Contributors of the CSRNet-keras project
- **GitHub Repository**: [CSRNet-keras](https://github.com/Neerajj9/CSRNet-keras)

### Enhancements in This Project
Key improvements made to the original CSRNet-keras codebase include:
- **Optimization**: Implementing code optimization techniques for enhanced efficiency.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Restructuring the code to improve clarity and maintainability.
- **Simplification**: Streamlining complex functionalities for easier usage and accessibility.
- **Format Change**: Transitioning the codebase from Jupyter Notebook format to pure Python scripts for better integration and deployment.
